    <h1>Sundial</h1>

    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

    <p>
      <strong>sundial measures time by the position of the sun</strong>. The
      most commonly seen designs, such as <br />
      the 'ordinary'or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface
      marked with the hours of <br />the day.As the position of the sun changes,
      the time indicated by the shadow changes. However, <br />
      sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a
      predictable shadow.

    <p>
      Most sundial designs indicate apparent time. Minor design variations can
      measure standard and <br />
      daylight saving time, as well.

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC)
      <strong> known from ancient <br />Egypt</strong>, and were developed
      further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman <br />
      cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old
      Testament (Isaiah 38:2).

    <p>
      The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca.
      100 BC) is said to have <br />invented a universal sundial that could be
      used anywhere on Earth. The French astronomer Oronce <br />
      Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer
      Giovanni Padovani published a <br />treatise on the sundial in 1570, in
      which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out <br />
      of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's
      Constructio instrumenti ad horologia <br />solaria discusses how to make a
      perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.

    <h3>Installation of standard sundials</h3>

    <p>
      Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By
      tilting such a sundial, it <br />may be installed so that it will keep
      time. However, some mass-produced garden sundials are <br />
